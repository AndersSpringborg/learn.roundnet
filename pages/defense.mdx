## Foundation

To read a set, focus on the ball and tracking its trajectory. To read a hitter pay attention to their dominant hand, their hip movements, and the set's position to predict where the ball may land. Playing defense during hard rallies - if the set is coming from far off the net, the defender should position themselves on the side the set is coming from, and adjust their position based on where the ball lands.

### How to Read a Set
1. Focus on the ball - by focusing on the ball, you will be able to read it off the net better, track it into your hand, control your game, and everything will slow down.
2. Focus on the trajectory - track the trajectory of the opponent's set and try to get to the other side of where that ball is set to.
### How to Read a Hitter
1. Know what the opposing team likes to hit - take note of the opposing team's preferred shots.
2. Play odds - force the hitter to be uncomfortable with their shot and make adjustments based on their hips.
3. Base off the set - if the set is coming from far off the net, be prepared to adjust based on the trajectory of the set. If the set is back up quickly, the defender should go where the set is coming from and the other defender should be mirrored on the other side of the net.

## Tips and tricks
1. Moving around the net: It is important to move around the net on your toes, ready to move in any direction. When moving in a certain direction, you should lead with the corresponding foot. This will allow you to easily dive for short balls or take off for deep balls.
2. Jab stepping or baiting the hitter: You can either bait the hitter to hit their big shot or try to have them hit a weaker shot. To do this, you can sit on their big shot and then dive in last second, or sit on their weaker shot and then bait them to hit it.
3. Body defense: When to body is situational. If the set is coming across the net towards you and you know the hitter is going to hit the opposite of you, you should slide in front of them to cut off the angle. This will either force them to hit a different shot or allow you to body the ball straight up.

## Strategies
The positions are:

- Split and Read
- Follow the Server
- Follow the Tracker
- Funnel Defense

These are not guaranteed defenses and are meant to set up for an optimal situation where the hitter is doing what the defender wants them to do.

### Split and Read
In this defense, one player defaults to the net while the other covers the hips of the hitter. The defender will adjust based on where the set goes, moving with the set.

### Follow the Server
In this defense, the server goes to the hitter's dominant hit, which is defaulted as a big right pull. The defender follows quickly to put pressure on the hitter, who may hit directly at the defender, push the ball, or hit a short shot.

### Follow the Tracker
The tracker is the player who follows the hitter's dominant hit. The server serves and the tracker moves quickly to put pressure on the hitter, who may hit to the defender's side or try to hit a shot away from the defender.

### Funnel Defense
In this defense, the server funnels the hitter to hit where the defenders are set up. The server may serve and then use their body to block, or serve and funnel the ball to a specific area for the other defender to make the play.

## Body Defense
Body defense should be used as a last option or desperation move when you're late to the area and can't make an athletic play.

When using body defense, you want to take up as much surface area as possible. There's three different techniques:
1. **Wall** - where you try to be a wall and direct the hit towards your partner
2. **Funnel** - where you dive in early to create a body surface and direct the hit towards your partner
3. **Bod of God** - where you dive in last second and try to get low to take the hit off
4. **Off the net** - when the ball hit you in the center of your chest, and you can't reach it with your hands. Make a body thurst to pass to your partner, preferably upwards, to get hang time.

It is very important getting into a good position when using body defense.If you're trying use the funnel technique, you need to five in early.

Body defense should not be used carelessly, and it should be used as a last resort when you're late to the area or as an early body defense to create a funnel.

## The Foot Block (Before NHZ)

The ball should be hit on the inside of the foot, and the knee should be slightly bent. The position should be in the middle of the net, not too high or too low. The foot block should only be used in certain scenarios, such as when there is a set off the net or a high set. When playing defense, it is better not to use this technique.

### Where to hit the ball
The ideal spot to hit the ball with your foot is the inside part of your foot. This way, you have the entire net to work with, and you can move your foot up and down the net to hit the ball. You want to position yourself with your knees slightly bent, and your foot in the middle, not too high or too low.

## Serve receive

To serve receive like a boss, focus on:

1. **Eye contact**: Observe the server's eye movements to anticipate where the ball will be served.
2. **Footwork**: Lead with your front foot and stay on your toes to move in any direction quickly. Rotate in a circular motion to cut off the angle and reduce the distance from the serving line.
3. **Body contact**: Cushion the ball instead of using a lot of power when receiving. Drop your hip to guide the ball and avoid getting hit by it.
4. **Rotate with the serving line**: When receiving, it's important to rotate with the serving line in order to cut off the angle of the serve. This will make it harder for the server to get aces.
5. **Odds**: Anticipate the server's strongest serve and move in that direction. For example, if they have a stronger right hand, move to your right to receive the ball.
6. **Guide the ball**: Instead of trying to hit the ball, focus on guiding it to the desired location. This will give you more control over the ball and prevent you from getting locked out or making mistakes.
