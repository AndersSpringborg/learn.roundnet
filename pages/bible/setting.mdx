title: "Setting"
---

Seting is the act of hitting the ball to your partner. There are two ways to set, overhand and underhand. The underhand set is the most common.

## Overhead Setting
- Used for high balls that are at least 4 feet off the net
- Ideal because it allows the player to see both the ball and their hand
- The wrist determines the direction of the set
- The motion is an upward trajectory, similar to a set
- To set further out, the wrist is angled further out
- To set closer, the wrist is angled closer to the body

## Deep Setting
- Involves chasing down a ball and running through the set
- Bad form: turning the body to make a set
- Decent form: setting across the shoulder
- Good form: setting over the same shoulder, following through to the net

## Underhand setting

1. **Arm technique**: Avoid trapping yourself by being too close to the body or fully extended. Use a ball placed in your armpit to prevent this. This allows for range of motion to adjust to a misread or hot ball.
2. **Footwork**: Move quickly to the set spot, with your feet facing where you want to finish the set. Use an athletic stance with knees bent. This allows for full rotation and small adjustments to the ball.
3. **Set placement**: Aim to set the ball over the net to give your partner more options.
4. **Contact and hand position**: Contact the ball in the middle of the hand, between the fingers and the palm. Relax your hand and have a mid-level firmness, not too hard or too loose.

Overall, use fluid motion and focus on reaching the set spot, making small adjustments to the ball, and pushing the set to target.
