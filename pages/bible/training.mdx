## Training routine

This training exercise is from TOPSRoundnet: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dI3HC7OjiCo

1. Start by just doing some touches, to get a feel for the ball. Get control of the ball within three touches, and then shoot it against a wall or over your head.
2. Practice your form, for serving. Just throw the ball on the net. You can practice spin, and muscle memory with this. Make sure to move your body, like you would when serving. High elbow, twist your hip think about where you release the ball, and how you follow through. Keep the speed low, and stand close to the net. ![image](/img/training/close_to_the_net.png)
3. Go to the serve line, and practice servers
4. Train put aways. Juggle the ball with two touches, and then put it away with both right and left hand. Stand close to a wall, so the ball comes back to you.
