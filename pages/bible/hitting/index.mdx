## Over the Net Hitting

1. The major tip is to get to the net after the first contact, serve, receive, or defensive up.
2. Square your hips to your partner for the most optimal set up to hit.
3. Straddle the net and be in an athletic stance, with your arm forming a right angle.
4. Swing in a pendulum motion, with the arm reaching to touch the net straight down.
5. Contact the ball with the fingers, not the palm.
6. Get low to the net and aim for a low trajectory across the net.
7. Avoid extending the legs and shoulders early, as this messes up the perfect low swing.
8. Focus on low, solid hits by loading up and snapping through.
9. Service, receive, or hit the ball up after first contact and sprint to the net.
10. Maintain an athletic stance with knees bent and be ready for the set.

Example of bad form: hitting with a high trajectory and standing up straight.
Example of good form: hitting low and solid, with a good athletic stance and pendulum swing.

## Off the Net Hitting

There are two types of off the net hitting:
1. When you are set up from the net (1-4 feet range)
2. When you are about 6 feet off the net

## Type 1 - When you are set up from the net (1-4 feet range)
- Start by getting over the net
- Move with the direction of the set
- One two three, square to the set
- Swing hard on the net while extending your knee and lifting your front shoulder to drop the arm

## Type 2 - When you are about 6 feet off the net
- This is used for a controlled semi-powerful shot to get the ball on the net
- Avoid flat footwork and try to have a full frontal assault on the ball
- Track the ball so that you can see both the ball and the net
- Everything comes straight through the net without any rotational business
