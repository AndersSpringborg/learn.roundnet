- [RP Stance](#foundation-of-serving--rp-stance-)

## Foundation of Serving "RP Stance"

1. The RP stance (hips parallel to the net stance) is a powerful serving stance.
2. The weight should be on the front foot, centered on the net, with the back leg bent.
3. The hips should fire first during the serve to create an arm lag and generate power.
4. The arm should come up high after the step, pushing down on the ball to create topspin.
5. The shoulders should not dip during the serve.
6. The hand should contact the ball at the top section, swiping over the ball to create topspin.
7. The serve sequence: step, toss, hit.

## BHAD Stance

1. The "BHAD Stance" is a great stance for serving.
2. The player stands with feet shoulder width apart, on their toes and ready to move to the right or left.
3. When rotating through the serve, the player should step in the direction of their travel, rotating with their hips first.
4. The non-tossing foot should be kept in place and not rotated to avoid losing aim.
5. The upper body should breeze through the motion, with a tight chest and belly button.
6. The elbow should be high for topspin serves and the ball should be contacted on the hand.
7. When faking, the player should pivot on their feet, switch hands if desired, and sell the fake with a high elbow.
8. The form should be good and ready to hit once the decision is made to serve.

## The Cut Serve

1. The cut serve is a type of serve in roundnet where spin is applied to the ball and it cuts off the net away from the opponent.
2. There are two main spins used in the cut serve: topspin and counterclockwise spin for right-handed players.
3. To create these spins, the ball should be gripped by the three main fingers and the top finger acts as a barrier. The wrist should snap and the spin should be created by getting over the top of the ball.
4. To practice the cut serve, first start by tossing the ball and flicking the wrist to create spin. Then move on to the light cut serve and gradually increase the power while maintaining the spin.
5. It's important to have a variety of serves in addition to the cut serve and to know where the ball is being hit on the hand. The toss for the cut serve should be the same as for other serves.

## The Drop Serve

When to use a drop shot:

- As a change-up when the opponent is too comfortable receiving
- When the opponent is jumping a lot and is not settled
- When you are at an advanced level and can fake left and right to throw off the opponent

How to do it:

1. The drop shot is a type of serve in roundnet.
2. The technique involves 80% of the arm motion being the same as a regular serve and the final adjustment being made with the wrist.
3. To hit a drop shot, the wrist is dropped right before hitting the ball to produce a backspin cut.
4. The ideal location to hit the drop shot is in the front meter net pocket area.

### Summary

The stance emphasizes rotating with the hips first and keeping the non-tossing foot in place. The upper body should have a tight chest and high elbow. The player should also focus on faking with a pivot on the feet and selling the fake with a high elbow. The goal is to be in good form and ready to hit once the decision is made to serve.
