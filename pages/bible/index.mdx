### Recreational Players (1.0)
As a beginner, the best thing you can do is just keep playing and enjoying the game. Don't worry about playing with strangers or pick-up games, just focus on the basics with your friends for now.

- Sometimes there is a beverage in hand

Here are some tips to help you get started:

- Always hit on 3
- Practice setting the ball well
- Hit hard and spike the ball 

### Beginners Players (2.0)

Now that you've got the basics down, it's time to step up your game. Consider playing more pick-up games and tournaments to test your skills.

This is how Spikeball defines the beginner level:
- You have the ability to teach someone else the rules of roundnet

Here are some tips to help you improve:

- Hit on 3, good setting, and hit hard - don't revert to old habits
- Hit the ball far, not high
- Play more pick-up games and tournaments
- Ask for advice from better players
- Participate in a tournament

 
### Intermediate Players (3.0)

At this stage, you should have some tournament experience and be a regular at pick-up games. To move up to the advanced level, focus on learning the correct ways to play and challenging yourself.

This is how Spikeball defines the intermediate level:

Here are some tips to help you improve
